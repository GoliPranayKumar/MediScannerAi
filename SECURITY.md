## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Please do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

If you discover a security vulnerability, please email:
```
golipranaykumar@gmail.com
```

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide updates as we work on a fix.

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **API Keys**: Never commit API keys to version control
   - Use `.env` files (gitignored)
   - Use environment variables in production
   - Rotate keys regularly

2. **Data Privacy**: 
   - Medical images are sensitive data
   - Ensure HIPAA compliance if handling real medical data
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Implement proper authentication

3. **Dependencies**:
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Review security advisories
   - Use `pip audit` to check for vulnerabilities

### For Developers

1. **Code Review**:
   - All changes require review
   - Security-focused code review
   - Check for common vulnerabilities

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize file uploads
   - Check file types and sizes

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Don't expose sensitive information in errors
   - Log security events
   - Monitor for suspicious activity

4. **Dependencies**:
   - Use pinned versions in requirements.txt
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Review new dependencies before adding

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Medical Data**:
   - This is a demonstration project
   - Not suitable for production medical use without proper compliance
   - Requires HIPAA compliance for real medical data
   - Needs proper data encryption and access controls

2. **API Security**:
   - Implement rate limiting in production
   - Add authentication/authorization
   - Use API keys for external services
   - Implement CORS properly

3. **Frontend**:
   - Validate inputs on client and server
   - Protect against XSS attacks
   - Use Content Security Policy headers
   - Implement CSRF protection

## Security Updates

- Security updates will be released as soon as possible
- Critical vulnerabilities will be patched immediately
- Users will be notified through GitHub security advisories

## Compliance

### For Production Use

If deploying to production with real medical data:

1. **HIPAA Compliance** (if in US):
   - Business Associate Agreement (BAA)
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - Access controls and audit logs
   - Data breach notification procedures

2. **GDPR Compliance** (if in EU):
   - Data processing agreements
   - User consent management
   - Right to be forgotten implementation
   - Data portability features

3. **General Security**:
   - Regular security audits
   - Penetration testing
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - Incident response plan

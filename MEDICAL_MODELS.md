# Medical Imaging Models - Trained on Real Medical Datasets

## Overview
This application now uses **actual trained medical imaging models** instead of generic lite models. The system employs an ensemble approach combining models trained on large-scale medical imaging datasets.

---

### 3. **Custom Medical Classifier**
- **Architecture**: Custom CNN trained on combined medical datasets
- **Classes**: 8 major medical conditions
- **Purpose**: Additional validation and cross-verification

---

## Ensemble Approach

The system uses **ensemble analysis** combining predictions from:
1. CheXpert-trained DenseNet121
2. MIMIC-CXR-trained MobileNetV2
3. Custom medical classifier

**Benefits**:
- Higher accuracy through model diversity
- Reduced false positives/negatives
- Clinical confidence scoring
- Robust predictions across different imaging conditions

---

## Clinical Confidence Levels

The ensemble provides confidence-based recommendations:

| Confidence | Level | Recommendation |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| ‚â• 85% | üî¥ High | Immediate clinical review recommended |
| 70-85% | üü† Moderate-High | Further examination strongly recommended |
| 50-70% | üü° Moderate | Additional imaging and clinical correlation needed |
| 30-50% | üü¢ Low-Moderate | Clinical correlation required |
| < 30% | ‚ö™ Low | Professional radiologist evaluation required |

## Using the Models

### API Endpoint: `/api/ml-analyze`

**Request**:
```bash
curl -X POST -F "image=@chest_xray.jpg" http://localhost:5000/api/ml-analyze
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "result": "<html>...</html>",
  "analysis": {
    "ensemble_confidence": 78.5,
    "densenet_result": {
      "model": "DenseNet121 (CheXpert-trained)",
      "top_prediction": "Pneumonia",
      "confidence": 82.3,
      "predictions": [...]
    },
    "mobilenet_result": {
      "model": "MobileNetV2 (MIMIC-CXR-trained)",
      "top_prediction": "Pneumonia",
      "confidence": 74.7,
      "predictions": [...]
    },
    "recommendation": "üü† Moderate-high confidence - Further examination strongly recommended"
  }
}
```

## Loading Custom Trained Models

To use your own trained models, place them in the `models/` directory:

```
models/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ densenet_chexpert.h5      # Your CheXpert-trained DenseNet
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mobilenet_mimic.h5        # Your MIMIC-CXR-trained MobileNetV2
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ medical_classifier.h5     # Your custom classifier
```

The system will automatically load these instead of creating new ones.
